Rye Sourdough Bread Recipe


I am giving the basic version, but I recommend experiments. This bread has a crispy crust and a soft interior. That is why additions in the form of whole almonds or hazelnuts are perfect. A hoop of seeds (eg. pumpkin, sunflower) or oatmeal will fit well. It's also worth experimenting with different types of flour.

1. 1-2 tablespoons of leaven fed 12 hours earlier 
2. 350 g of wholemeal rye flour (preferably the one intended for baking bread)
3. 200 g of white rye flour (you may alternatively use any flour, wheat flour is good as it helps in rising)
4. 350 ml of lukewarm water
5. one and a half teaspoons of salt (about 9 g)

Preparation of sourdough bread

1. I always start with feeding the leaven and putting it aside for 12 hours in a warm place.
2. Two tablespoons (170 - 180 g) of so prepared leaven I add to 150 g of rye flour and 150 ml of water, mix these ingredients and set aside for about 12  hours - this is how the leaven is made. 
3. After these 12 hours, I add all the remaining ingredients to the leaven and mix it quite thoroughly with a spoon.
4. Then I transfer the dough to a greased and sprinkled with bran, breadcrumbs or a bit of semolina (a form about 30 cm long).
5. I cover the prepared dough with a cloth or foil and leave it in a warm place to rise for about 5 hours so that it rises and doubles its volume (sometimes the bread doubles in 2-3 hours, but it really doesn't like cold, so make sure that windows are closed, particularly in the winter).
6. I put the bread in a cold oven, which I set at 220 degrees Celsius (upper and lower heater) and bake for 60 minutes. 
7. I immediately take the baked bread out of the mold and cool it on a wire rack. We are always looking forward to the first bite and eat the slightly warm buttered heel!
